CF Assignment
A React page to load and render the list of tasks created by a user

Please follow these steps to run the project locally:
1. Clone the project from GitHub by executing 'git clone https://github.com/nikunj2991/cf_assignment.git' in your terminal
2. Navigate to local repository folder (Execute this command 'cd cf_assignment');
3. If a. you have Yarn installed, run 'yarn' command
   else b. execute 'npm i'
4. Run 'npm run start', which should start the webpack server and open your default browser at localhost:8080

Note: I will be adding the test soon!
